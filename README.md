# Telecom-Churn
A churn analysis study project with data taken from Maven Analytics

In this project, I tried to analyze and visualize the details of a fictional Communications Company’s data. 
This dataset included many details such as customer demographics such as age, gender, marital status 
and product details such as Tenure in Months, service types, offer types made to the client, contract length and customer status etc.

This dataset was taken from Maven Analytics.

Part 1: General Customer Data:
![t1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54e3fbfa-ff69-4365-9df8-9eeae393d262)
According to this data, we had a total amount of 7043 customers. 67% (4720) of them stayed with us, 6% (454) of them newly joined the company. We lost 27% (1869) of our current clients, which makes around a ¼ of our total clients.

Part 2: Demographics in Churn, Join and Staying Status
![t2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da656304-2576-49a0-8b4f-a54065e8bc20)

In our churn tables, 65+ is dominant in both gender, followed by 45-54 in females and 55-65 in males and 35-44 being the 3rd in both tables. Around 64% of these people are single.

In our join tables, 35-44 is dominant in both genders, followed by 25-34 in males and 55-65 in females. 45-54 in males and 25-34 in females take the 3rd place. Around 81% of these people are single

In our last table about the stayed percent, we see that people in the age groups of 55-65, 35-44 and 45-54 make up the majority. Around 56% of these people are married.

According to these demographics we can say single people tend to churn and join more than the married ones. Especially single adults and elders in both genders tend to churn and join more. Married customers between the ages 35-65 tend to stay for a long time and have the highest potential to become loyal and high value customers.

Part 3: Churn Details in Technical Parts

  When we check our decomposition tree regarding the churn reasons, we see majority of the churns were made because of our competitors. Our competitors offering better deals and technology as well as better download speeds with more data made us lose clients.
	The second reason of losing the clients is the dissatisfaction from our services. Churn reasons give is many complains about low quality products, unreliable network connection, limited range and poor support.
   Third reason of losing the clients is the attitude of our support and service employees. There are many dissatisfied customers who had bad experience with support services.

Moving on to the offer types, we see that the company fails to offer a satisfactory deal for new coming customers. Half of the customers don’t get an offer. We also can see that Offer E is one of the greatest reasons of churn.

In the Internet Type section, we see that most of the churners had Fiber Optic internet. Combined with many complains about network and equipment, we can say that there is a problem with the fiber optic services.

As we check the churn rates by contract and tenure length, we see that monthly deals tend to get churned very easily. Almost 90% of our month-to-month deals fail to keep the client for the long term. As we can see, longer the contract is, lower the churn rates are.

Final Analysis:
1) More Competitive Deals: Company has to offer better deals than their competitors, especially the monthly contracts should be adjusted to keep the customers happy and with us.
2) Improve Services and Products: Product quality especially in Fiber Optic section and network devices should be upgraded to give customers a lot more satisfactory and reliable services
3) Support and Service Improvement: Support and service employees must be trained to have a better attitude and support services on the internet website should be upgraded.
